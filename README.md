# Computer Science A-level Coursework Project

A cheap, watered-down version of AES encryption made in C#
**NOTE:** The built-in Aes class was obviously not used in the making of this project

I don't know if it actually works but someone can try to decrypt it if they want

I may link my **ANALYSIS** and **DESIGN** documents to this in the future
